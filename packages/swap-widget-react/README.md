| **Wallet Connectivity**       | Easily connect your wallet using [TxnLab's use-wallet](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main). The widget supports direct wallet integration or, if your protocol has its own infrastructure, facilitates the exchange of unsigned transactions.                                                                             |
| **API Utilization**           | Harness the power of Folks Router's APIs for fetching swap quotations and related transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Swap Modes**                | Dynamic swap modes allow you to execute "fixed input" or "fixed output" swaps based on the last manually entered value.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
